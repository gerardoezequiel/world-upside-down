# Writing Style Guide

## Language
- British English throughout (colour, organise, centre, favour)
- Never use em dashes. Use colons, semicolons, or full stops instead.
- No Oxford comma unless required for clarity

## Tone
- Intellectually playful. Like a design professor who is also a poet.
- Smart but accessible. No jargon unless cartographic, and then explain through use.
- Subversive but not aggressive. Like a well-designed protest poster.

## Content Principles
- Every word earns its place
- Subtitles: under 50 characters, must teach or provoke
- Microcopy: 3 to 7 words, self-explanatory
- Longform: engage with ideas, not just describe them
- Academic precision without academic stuffiness
- Balance depth with readability

## Examples

Microcopy (3-7 words):
- "Flip your perspective" (orientation toggle)
- "Every map is an argument" (story section)
- "North is a convention" (subtitle)

Subtitles (under 50 characters):
- "You've been holding the map wrong"
- "The first photo of Earth had south on top"
- "Orientation is a political choice"

## Voice Hierarchy
1. Copywriter sets the tone and voice
2. Writer composes the narrative
3. Philosopher provides depth and intellectual rigour
4. Researcher provides factual grounding and sources

## References
- Cite sources. Use Zotero for academic references.
- Prefer primary sources over secondary
- Name specific thinkers, texts, and historical events
- Ground claims in evidence, not assertion
