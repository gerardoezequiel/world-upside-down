# Argument Mapping Framework

Adapted from Rationale Online's methodology for structured critical thinking.
Used by all agents when making claims, evaluating reasoning, or writing persuasive content.

## Core Structure

Every significant claim should be mapped before being written as prose:

```
CLAIM (conclusion)
├── REASON 1 (premise supporting the claim)
│   ├── EVIDENCE (what supports this reason)
│   └── OBJECTION (strongest counter to this reason)
│       └── REBUTTAL (response to the objection)
├── REASON 2
│   ├── EVIDENCE
│   └── OBJECTION
│       └── REBUTTAL
└── COUNTER-ARGUMENT (strongest case against the whole claim)
    └── RESPONSE (why the claim holds despite the counter)
```

## Three Heuristics

### 1. MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive)
When listing reasons, perspectives, or categories:
- **No overlaps**: each reason covers distinct ground
- **No gaps**: together they cover all relevant ground
- Ask: "Is there a perspective we have not considered?"

### 2. Holding Hands
Every premise must connect logically to its conclusion. No leaps.
- If you cannot trace a clear logical path from evidence to claim, the argument has a gap.
- Ask: "Does this reason actually support this conclusion, or does it support something adjacent?"

### 3. Rabbit Rule
No conclusion should appear without visible premises.
- Every claim must show its working. No assertions without evidence.
- Ask: "Where did this claim come from? What is the evidence?"

## When to Use Argument Mapping

### Writing Team
- **Philosopher**: Map the core argument before framing it as prose
- **Researcher**: Structure findings as evidence trees, not flat lists
- **Writer**: Ensure narrative follows logical structure, not just rhetorical flow
- **Copywriter**: Verify that short claims (subtitles, microcopy) are backed by mapped reasoning

### Domain Team
- **Activist**: Map objections and rebuttals for every critical claim
- **Cartographer**: Map the argument for every design decision (why this projection, why this symbology)
- **Urbanist/Architect**: Map spatial claims (why this feature matters) with evidence

### Engineering Team
- **Technologist**: Map architecture decisions as arguments (trade-offs as objections/rebuttals)
- **QA Engineer**: Map test rationale (why this test, what does it prove)

### Strategy
- **Innovator**: Map idea proposals with reasons, objections, and feasibility evidence
- **Planner**: Use MECE to verify quality checklists have no gaps

## Applying to Content Writing

Before writing any substantive content:

1. **State the claim** in one sentence
2. **List 3 to 5 reasons** supporting it (check MECE: no overlaps, no gaps)
3. **For each reason**, identify the strongest objection
4. **For each objection**, write a rebuttal grounded in evidence
5. **Identify the single strongest counter-argument** to the whole claim
6. **Write a response** that honestly engages with the counter-argument
7. **Only then** compose the prose, using the map as scaffolding

The prose should not show the scaffolding explicitly, but every paragraph should trace back to a mapped node.
