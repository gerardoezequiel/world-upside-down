# Project Roadmap

## Vision
World Upside Down: an interactive cartographic art tool that challenges the convention that north is up. Maps as art, cartography as critique, orientation as choice.

## Current State
- Landing page with Three.js dither globe
- Interactive map with riso screenprint aesthetic
- 6 style presets, 19 fonts, 34 riso inks
- Export to PNG, URL sharing, geocoding
- Story page (editorial scroll)
- 22-agent swarm with 11 workflow Skills (consolidated from 24)
- Modular codebase (16 extracted modules from main.ts)
- OpenClaw integration: MCP bridge configured, cross-machine cooperation enabled

## Active Work
- Foundry-inspired self-improvement: workflow observation hook active, collecting data
- Image generation integration research (fal.ai FLUX.2 Pro, Ideogram)
- Agent metrics tracking: measuring spawn counts, success rates, utilisation

## Next
- Story page content production (editorial writing about map orientation)
- Feature polish: mobile responsiveness, accessibility audit
- Print export: high-resolution poster output for physical riso printing
- Test framework setup (Vitest or Playwright)

## Future Plans
- Foundry Phase 2: analyse workflow patterns once 50+ log entries collected
- Foundry Phase 3: auto-crystallisation of detected patterns into Skills
- New projections: Winkel Tripel, Robinson, Equal Earth
- Mobile-first redesign for touch interaction
- Collaborative map making (shared sessions)
- QGIS plugin for cartographic workflows
- Physical print partnerships (riso studios)

## Completed
- main.ts decomposition (2489 lines → 16 modules + 142-line orchestrator)
- Agent swarm creation (23 agents, 5 teams, 4 team leads)
- Skills system (8 workflow playbooks)
- Argument mapping framework integration (MECE, Holding Hands, Rabbit Rule)
- Flat Director architecture (Skills as coordination, not agent delegation)
- MCP tool audit and assignment across all agents
- Memory directory structure and seeding
- Agent swarm improvements: prompt sharpening, quality hooks, memory seeding
- Prompt improvement pipeline: UserPromptSubmit hook + /prompt-improver skill
- OpenClaw research and integration documentation
- OpenClaw MCP bridge configuration and cross-machine cooperation
- Agent consolidation: ux-researcher + ui-researcher → ux-ui-researcher (24 → 22 agents)
- Director failure handling protocol (4-level escalation)
- Cross-team handoff patterns for tightly coupled work
- Prompt-improver auto-skill suggestion
- Agent metrics tracking system
