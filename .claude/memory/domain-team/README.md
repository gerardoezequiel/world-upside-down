## Cartographic Principles
1. Orientation is political — south-up (bearing 180) is the thesis
2. Projections distort — making this visible is the point
3. Scale bar must be mathematically correct
4. Labels are power — naming is sovereignty
5. Colour is ink — physical Riso drums, not digital palettes

## Projections in Use
- **Mercator**: default, bearing 180 (south-up)
- **Globe**: toggle via Mercator/Globe button
- **Dymaxion (Fuller)**: experimental, `src/dymaxion.ts`

## Critical Framework
- See activist agent for full decolonial framework
- Key references: Denis Wood, J.B. Harley, McArthur's Universal Corrective Map
- Al-Idrisi (1154): south-up predates European standardisation
- Counter-Cartographies Collective, Orangotango+ "This Is Not an Atlas"

## Decolonial Checklist
- Does the map centre Europe by default? (We don't — south-up)
- Are indigenous place names considered?
- Is the projection choice made visible to the user?
- Are claims substantive, not performative?

## Map Data Sources
- OpenStreetMap via Protomaps tiles
- Nominatim for geocoding/reverse geocoding
- Natural Earth for geographic features
