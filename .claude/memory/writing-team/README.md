# Writing Team Memory

## Voice Decisions
- Intellectually playful: like a design professor who is also a poet
- Smart but accessible; no jargon unless cartographic
- Subversive but not aggressive
- Every word earns its place
- See `.claude/docs/style-guide.md` for full rules

## Language Rules
- British English throughout (colour, organise, centre)
- Never use em dashes; use colons, semicolons, or full stops
- No Oxford comma unless required for clarity
- Subtitles under 50 characters
- Microcopy 3 to 7 words

## Content Principles
- Engage with ideas, not just describe them
- Balance academic precision with readability
- Cite sources naturally within flow
- Every paragraph earns its place

## Key Sources (add as discovered)
- Denis Wood, "The Power of Maps"
- J.B. Harley, "Deconstructing the Map"
- See researcher's briefs for full bibliography

## Content Structure Decisions
- Long-scroll narrative for story pages
- Section breaks at conceptual shifts, not arbitrary lengths
- See ux-researcher recommendations for reading patterns

## Argument Mapping
- All substantive content uses `.claude/docs/argument-mapping.md`
- MECE for structure, Rabbit Rule for evidence, Holding Hands for logic
