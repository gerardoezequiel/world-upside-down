# Copywriter Memory

## Project Voice (confirmed across codebase)
- Three registers: toast (short/wry), CTA (lowercase/intimate), editorial (conversational authority)
- Toast messages are the soul of the brand: 3-12 words, no question marks, declarative or imperative
- British English throughout (colonisers, neighbourhoods, colour)
- No em dashes in microcopy; landing page currently uses them (legacy, should phase out)
- Subtitle pattern: "an exercise in [gerund] [noun]" (currently "an exercise in unlearning north")
- Share copy uses {city} templating with 5 variants per context
- The voice is confident but never preachy; subversive but rooted in real citations

## Key Brand Lines (existing, canonical)
- "An Exercise in Unlearning North" (hero title, canonical subtitle)
- "The first photo of Earth had south on top. NASA flipped it. This map flips it back." (OG description)
- "No north. No south. Just Earth." (dymaxion label)
- "There is no neutral map." (colophon closing)
- "The map is not a picture. It is an argument." (Denis Wood quote, pull)

## Style Rules
- British English always
- No em dashes (use commas, full stops, or restructure)
- Subtitles under 50 characters
- Microcopy 3-7 words
- Claims must be substantive, not performative
